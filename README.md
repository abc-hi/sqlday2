**** Here I have created tables on Mysql workbench and corresponding EER diagram has been attached with this****



The Tables are:


  1. Learners table

  2. Course table

  3. Mentor table

  4. Tasks table

  5. Batch table

  6. Mark table


Each table is connected with foreign key to represent that it is relational tables.
